# 🌾 Farm Security System
This project is a 𝗙𝗮𝗿𝗺 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 designed to help farmers protect their crops and land using affordable hardware and software. The system integrates Arduino-based sensors and logic to monitor the farm and provide alerts in case of intrusions or suspicious activities.

## 📌 Features
- 🚨 Intrusion detection using motion sensors  
- 🔊 Buzzer/alarm system for immediate alerts  
- 🌙 Works effectively during both day and night  
- 🔋 Low-cost and energy efficient design  
- 📡 Can be extended to include GSM/IoT modules for remote alerts  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 𝗔𝗿𝗱𝘂𝗶𝗻𝗼 IDE (C++ via `.ino` sketch)  
- 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲: ESP32 board, PIR sensor, buzzer, LEDs, jumper wires, breadboard  
- 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Keynote file included (`FARM SECURITY SYSTEM Final.key`)

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 🔧 Hardware Setup
1. Connect the PIR motion sensor to the Arduino board:  
   - VCC → 5V  
   - GND → GND  
   - OUT → Digital Pin (as specified in code)  
2. Connect buzzer/LED for alert signals  
3. Upload the `.ino` file to your Arduino using Arduino IDE  

### 💻 Software Setup
1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
2. Open `sketch_may6db.ino`  
3. Select the correct board and port from 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 → 𝗕𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱/𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁  
4. Click 𝗨𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱
